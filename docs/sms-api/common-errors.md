# Common Errors and Solutions

Below is a list of common errors encountered while using the SMS APIs, along with their possible causes and solutions.

## **1. Invalid Credentials**
### Possible Causes:
- Incorrect **API Key** (Most cases: you have acquired an **App Key** instead of an **API Key**).
- Incorrect **Partner ID**.
- Your account does not have an active user under it.

### Solution:
- Verify that you are using the correct **API Key** (not the App Key).
- Ensure the **Partner ID** matches what was assigned.
- Double-check the **Sender ID** and ensure it is spelled exactly as assigned.


## **2. Sender is not assigned**
### Possible Causes:
- The **Sender ID** is not assigned to your account.
- Wrong **Sender ID Name** (**Case-sensitive**: Use exactly as assigned).

### Solution:
- Check if the Sender ID has been properly assigned.
- Contact support if the issue persists.
